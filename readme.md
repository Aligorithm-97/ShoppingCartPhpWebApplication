# Project Information
Our project is simple shopping cart web application with CRUD actions and contains two main roles which are admin and user.

# How it works?
In order to run and test our web application you have to download xampp web server software. Then you have to move the project file in xampp/htdocs folder.
For the database you need to go localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser and create a database called ise_project and then you need to import the ise_project.sql which is coming with the zip file or you can copy the codes inside the ise_project.sql file and paste the codes into sql part in phpmyadmin.

# Test
After the above phases in order to test the web application you should go localhost/ise in your browser and you can see the user pages and try some actions like registering the site and ordering some items. For the admin side you need to go localhost/ise/admincontrolpanel in your browser and you will see a login page. You can enter the admin control panel with the following values:

email : ali@gmail.com
password : 123

After the login you can see the pages to control the products categories and also you can display orders and customers.
